Watson Speech JavaScript SDK Examples
=====================================

This folder has example Node.js and Python servers to generate auth tokens and 
several html files (in `static/`) with different examples of using the Speech SDK. 

There are also a few audio files to test with in the `static/` folder.


Prerequisite
------------

* IBM Watson Speech to Text service credentials - see [Service credentials for Watson services](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/common/getting-started-credentials.html)
* Node.js OR Python
* [Bower](https://bower.io/) for installing client-side dependencies


Setup - Node.js
---------------

1. `cd` into the `examples/` directory and run `npm install` to grab dependencies (this automatically runs `bower install`)
2. edit `tts-token.js` and `stt-token.js` to include your service credentials (or create a `.env` file)
3. run `npm start`
4. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000/ to see the examples.


Setup - Python
--------------

1. `cd` into the `examples/` directory and run `pip install watson_developer_cloud flask python-dotenv pyopenssl` (or `easy_install...`) to install python dependencies.
2. run `bower install` to install client-side dependencies
3. edit `server.py` to include your service credentials (or create a `.env` file)
4. run `python server.py`
5. Open your browser to http://localhost:5000/ to see the examples.


Notes
-----

* The examples all use [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) (a modern promise-based replacement for XMLHttpRequest) to retrieve auth tokens. Most supported browsers include a native fetch implementation, but a pollyfill is included in the top-level module for older browsers.
* The examples use a Node.js server to generate tokens. It doesn't have to be written in Node.js, but *some server-side token generator is required*. The SDK will not accept your service credentials directly, and you can not use them to generate a token client-side. SDKs are available for [Node.js](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-sdk#authorization), [Java](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/java-sdk), [Python](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk/blob/master/examples/authorization_v1.py), and there is a [REST API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/common/getting-started-tokens.html) for use with other languages (or `curl`).
* The Speech SDK may be used in browserify, Webpack, or as a standalone library. Most of the examples use the standalone version either installed via bower or symlinked to the root directory when developing locally.
